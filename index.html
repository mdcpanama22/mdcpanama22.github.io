   Throughout my life, I had the good fortune to be able to travel from Ecuador, Brazil, Panama, Nicaragua, and now Colombia. My family traveled from country to country following my dad, who despite having lost his sight, continued to tirelessly work in organizations like Plan International, and currently in the Peace Corps providing humanitarian and developmental aid to impoverished communities worldwide. Having seen my father lose his eyesight at the age of four, and watching him not give up, has given me the drive to develop my passion to help others. I just had no excuse, because if he could do it, then I can do it too. My passion to help others manifested itself in my love for computer science and game design, as I continue to figure out ways to push the boundaries of hardware and software to help aid peoples day-to-day lives, be it through learning, or mental health.
<br><br>
    My goal is to form part of the development teams that work on finding new ways to bring information, and commodity to those who suffer from handicaps, working on research aimed at using immersive technologies to aid in learning and helping mental health patients. I hope to bring to light the potential behind these immersive technologies by using the more commercially available virtual, augmented, and mixed reality headsets, alongside custom hardware, to bring these solutions to the general public.
<br><br>
    As a recent 2020 graduate from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, with a dual bachelor of science in Computer Science, and Games and Simulation Arts and Sciences, I have had the chance to try the many flavors and dimensions of my fields ranging from data science, machine learning, and data analysis to artificial intelligence, shaders, game design, and development. I aim to keep working on research, and games that mix both of my fields, to bring out the best of both worlds while creating memorable and cohesive experiences to all players alike.

                            <p>As proud members of the Eco Resilience Games team, our noble mission was to enlighten and inspire others about the critical significance of freshwater ecology through innovative technologies. Under the visionary guidance of Professor Kathleen Ruiz, we harnessed the power of virtual reality, augmented reality, and virtual touchpools to construct a captivating world where individuals could fully immerse themselves and cultivate a profound understanding of the vital role played by freshwater ecosystems. Within these dynamic interactive experiences, participants embarked on a captivating journey, engaging directly with an array of microscopic wonders including zooplankton, phytoplankton, and ancient microfossils. They also traversed through different epochs, witnessing firsthand the evolution of these aquatic environments. Our planet's freshwater ecosystems are undeniably breathtaking, yet the need for their preservation is increasingly urgent. Our aspiration was to extend this awareness beyond the confines of traditional museum exhibits. We aimed to provide people with the opportunity to bring these immersive experiences into their own homes, enabling them to connect with the beauty and fragility of freshwater ecology on a personal level.</p>

The primary focus of the project was to transport users into a simulated environment of China using a 360-degree panoramic projection, aptly located in Studio 2 within EMPAC. The overarching goal was to immerse users in a manner reminiscent of real-world language assimilation experiences in China.

This research-oriented tool was developed to support students enrolled in Mandarin courses at RPI. As a member of the undergraduate development team, our mission was to construct a comprehensive platform incorporating various tools and interactive games to collect user data, ultimately enhancing Mandarin language learning through AI assistance. I was instrumental in establishing a data pipeline using React and Flask Python, facilitating real-time data processing and seamless interaction between AI agents and students.

Terrium is played on land, sea, and air, as well as having a world creation mode where players can create maps that they can play in. The game revolves around the concept of non-violent combat, where instead of players having guns and blowing each other up, we decided to take a different approach. With the use of lasers, relaxing original music, and beautiful sound effects, we hope to create a serene, engaging game that players can enjoy. My roles thus far have been helping with debugging, adding components such as the tutorial, develop the business model, and pushing the game from alpha to beta.

                            <p>A project I started a year ago intending to create a turn-by-turn strategy board game, revolving around the use of unique minions and spells to dominate one's opponent. The game was created on a physical board, and character sheets that the players use to keep track of the values. All of the information is then displayed on the UI for the players to process more easily. I worked on this as part of my Game Development 2 project, but have since been developing it on my own to create a more seamless experience.

                            <p> Initially a project started in Experimental Game Design, we developed a cooperative interactive game, with custom hardware controls. To play the game, it is required that two players have to figure out what combinations of controls they need to be able to manipulate a half organic, half robotic mouse, in a 3D world environment. This game aimed to show the importance of cooperation and communication, to be able to advance and explore the secrets of the in-game world.

                                            We used Unity as our game engine, as well as Maya for modeling the character and objects in the 3D environment. We were also chosen to exhibit our game at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute booth at the 2019 Game Development Convention.

                            <p>The original Voder was created by Homer Dudley in Bell Telephone Laboratory, during the years of 1937-1938, and then showcased in the New York World's Fair in 1939. After that the Voder was stowed away forever. We believe this old, but not yet lost technology, could be of some use, especially as a different approach for a more efficient and lightweight (in terms of usage) text-to-speech system. We are working on digitizing the Voder in our Voder 2017 speech sythensizer, using spectrograms, and sound frequencies for consonants and vowels. We are using the results to create scripts to ease the usage of the digital Voder we have created.

We have been actively reaching out to AT&ampT and Bell Labs for information about frequencies and graphs for pronunciation, and relevant archived information.

                                <p> As a 3-week assignment our group developed a game based on the theme (paraphrased), "working together for a common goal". With this idea we decided to build on a mechanic where the player can switch between the characters in the game. Using that mechanic, we then developed puzzles based on handicaps of the characters fears (i.e. afraid of the dark, can't be alone). This requires the player to use all the characters to solve the puzzles and get through the area. We are addressing individual fears, as well as recognizing, empthaizing with and working together around those fears for a common goal. The characters in our game are children, as we were playing off the theme of child-like fear, but also creative problem solving.

                            <p> As a 2-week assignment our group developed a game based on the adjectives "elude" and "creep". We decided to make a very basic dungeon crawler with the place being one of the haunted building on our campus, and the character as a RPI student. This is the first game I ever worked on, and helped solidify my love for game development. The game is using the HaxeFlixel engine, and was a way to learn how to work with 2D engines. The character, and enemies (police and ghosts) are made up of 2D sprites.
