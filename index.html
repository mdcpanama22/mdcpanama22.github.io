                                <p>
                                    I have a passion for using technology to improve day-to-day life, and involve myself in projects that push the boundaries of how people interact with technology. I wish to pursue these goals by developing software to engage those with handicaps, allowing them to get access to the same information as everyone else. Additionally, I wish to create simulations of psychological disorders, enabling friends and family members to empathize with those who suffer from them. There is great potential in learning through immersion and I wish to use virtual reality, augmented reality, and software for education. 
<br></br>
                                    I am a graduate from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute with a dual degree in Computer Science and Games and Simulation Arts and Sciences. Throughout my academic career I have had the chance to try the many flavors and dimensions of my field ranging from data mining, AI, shaders, and game development to name a few. I am interested in the crosssection of computer science with various fields, and hope to keep using it as a tool to learn more about the world.

                            <br> </br>
                                    My hopes is to join a team of passionate developers, who wish to push the boundaries of what we can do with technologies, and to create innovative tools, with the hopes to help
                                    I hope to help people understand each other better, providing a platform for empathy.

                            <p>As a team member for <i>The Aquatic Messenger</i> and <i>The World of Plankton</i>, with the direction of Professor Kathleen Ruiz, we have the mission to educate others about the importance of freshwater ecology. We are using virtual reality and creating a world where a person can immerse themselves in the waters of Lake George. The player will then be able to interact with different zooplankton, phytoplankton and microfossils of different sizes, and in different time periods. Our fresh water ecology is beautiful and our need to conserve it is urgent. We hope to create more awareness by creating these programs for museum settings as well as the general population worldwide.

                            <p>Terrium is a longterm online vehicular laser tag game under the direction of Eric Lujan. Terrium is played on land, sea, and air, as well as having a world creation mode where players can create maps that they can actually play in. The game revolves around the concept of non-violent combat, where instead of players having guns and blowing each other up, we decided to take a different approach. With the use of lasers, relaxing original music, and beautiful sound effects, we hope to create a serene, engaging game that players can enjoy. My roles thus far have been helping with debugging, adding components such as the tutorial, develop the business model, and pushing the game from alpha to beta.

                            <p>The original Voder was created by Homer Dudley in Bell Telephone Laboratory, during the years of 1937-1938, and then showcased in the New York World's Fair in 1939. After that the Voder was stowed away forever. We believe this old, but not yet lost technology, could be of some use, especially as a different approach for a more efficient and lightweight (in terms of usage) text-to-speech system. We are working on digitizing the Voder in our Voder 2017 speech sythensizer, using spectrograms, and sound frequencies for consonants and vowels. We are using the results to create scripts to ease the usage of the digital Voder we have created.

We have been actively reaching out to AT&ampT and Bell Labs for information about frequencies and graphs for pronunciation, and relevant archived information.

                            <p>A project I started a year ago with the intention to create a turn-by-turn strategy board game, revolving around the use of unique minions and spells to dominate one's opponent. The game was created on a physical board, and character sheets that the players use to keep track of the values. All of the information is then displayed on the UI for the players to process more easily. I worked on this as part of my Game Development 2 project, but expanding on it beyond the course.

                                <p> As a 3-week assignment our group developed a game based on the theme (paraphrased), "working together for a common goal". With this idea we decided to build on a mechanic where the player can switch between the characters in the game. Using that mechanic, we then developed puzzles based on handicaps of the characters fears (i.e. afraid of the dark, can't be alone). This requires the player to use all the characters to solve the puzzles and get through the area. We are addressing individual fears, as well as recognizing, empthaizing with and working together around those fears for a common goal. The characters in our game are children, as we were playing off the theme of child-like fear, but also creative problem solving.

                                        <p> As a 2-week assignment our group developing a game based on the book "The Mystery of the Hansom Cab", as well as only having a tap and drag (click and drag) mechanic.

                                       <p>
                                        Using Phaser and Javascript, we were able to create a simple, but fun mystery game having players search the homes of suspects, and finding items in the environments. All the art is hand drawn to create a noir effect, as well as having original music.
